**FOSSBilling** is a free open source, billing and client management solution. Whatever the size of your online services business, whether a startup or established, FOSSBilling can help you to automate your invoicing, incoming payments, and client management and communication.

If you run a web hosting business and are looking for an open-source alternative for billing and client management, FOSSBilling is the answer. Although it is mostly used as a solution for hosting businesses, there is no reason why you can't use FOSSBilling for any other kind of online business, like digital downloads. 

FOSSBilling is designed to be extensible and to integrate easily with your favourite server management software and payment gateways.

ðŸ“¥ This is self-hosted software that is free for anyone to install â€” All you need is a web server, running PHP and a MySQL database.

All repositories created under the FOSSBilling organisation are subject to the Apache 2.0 license, except where explicitly stated otherwise in the repository.
